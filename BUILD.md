# How to build parserlib

Parserlib is completely a headers only library, so there is no need to build it.

However, there are examples and tests that can be build.

For that, you need to use [cpp_build](https://github.com/axilmar/cpp_build "cpp_build"), which is a build system I created based on c++.

## Windows

After installing cpp_build, you run either

- clean.bat, to clean the project or
- build.bat, to build everything.

## Linux

cpp_build is not yet integrated with Linux, but it will eventually be.
